 <h1>SplitsBrowser file load test page &ndash; About</h1>
 <div style="width: 500px">
  <p>The <a href="splitsbrowser-file-load-test.html">file load test page</a> is a
  page that allows someone to load an event data file and see whether the latest
  version of SplitsBrowser reads it or not.  The version of SplitsBrowser is shown
  at the top, and it also available when hovering over the SplitsBrowser logo in the
  top-left corner.</p>
  
  <p>There are two ways to load a file.  Use the button marked 'Choose file' and
  choose the file using the file picker that appears, or drag a file over the
  dotted box.  Please note dragging a file over the dotted box may not work if you
  have a virus scanner that has installed a toolbar into your browser.</p>
  
  <p>Some orienteering results files use different character sets.  If the display
  looks wrong (e.g. some characters appear as &#xFFFD; or &Atilde;&copy;, for example),
  try changing this from the default (UTF-8) and loading the file again.</p>
 
  <p>The test page runs entirely in your browser &ndash; it does not store your event data
  on a server anywhere.  In order to do this it relies on a feature of modern browsers
  (the HTML5 File API), which most browsers support.  Internet Explorer 9 is the only
  browser I know of that SplitsBrowser supports but which doesn't work with this page.
  There may be others.</p>
 
  <p>The 'Link' function has been disabled for this page, as there's not a lot of
  point to it.  You can't really share a link to this test page with certain
  competitors, chart types etc. selected, as you would also have to share the data
  file.</p>
